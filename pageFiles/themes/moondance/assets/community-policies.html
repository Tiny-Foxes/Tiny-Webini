<h1 class="page-title">Community polices</h1>
<p data-translation="theseRulesApplyOnDiscordForum">These rules apply to the Discord server and Project OutFox forum unless otherwise noted.
    Although these rules are simple and concise, it is still important to read them carefully;</p>

<ol>
    <li data-translation="positiveEnvironment">Our community platforms are designed to be a positive environment for everyone. Keep drama out of the discussions, and do not harass, slander, threaten others for any reason, or otherwise post hate speech.</li>
    <li data-translation="notImpersonateStaffMembers">Do not impersonate staff members.</li>
    <li data-translation="notPersonalInformation">Do not post personal information about other users without their permission.</li>
    <li data-translation="notAbovePG13">Do not post content which exceeds a “PG-13” rating, is obviously&nbsp;NSFW, or is otherwise
        prohibited under relevant terms of use.</li>
    <li data-translation="notSpam">Do not spam or post too rapidly on the Discord server. This applies to any form of content,
        including messages, emojis, images, etc.</li>
    <li data-translation="notPromote">Do not unduly promote other projects/Discord servers/etc. without permission, particularly
        if they do not involve StepMania</li>
    <li data-translation="notControversial">Do not discuss potentially controversial aspects of subjects such as politics or religion.
    </li>
    <li data-translation="notCopyrightMaterial">Do not post any content that violates copyrights or is otherwise illegal.</li>
    <li data-translation="notSimfiledDownloads">Direct links to simfile downloads (defined as a clickable link), if they do not contain
        music that was distributed by its creator at no charge, or is otherwise licensed under terms
        (such as a Creative Commons licence) that explicitly grant permission for redistribution,
        can not be shared on any official Moondance platforms. In other words, we do not know where
        you can find simfiles; you should know already. We’re not gonna help unless it’s 100% legal.
        Links to videos showcasing simfiles are okay.</li>
    <li data-translation="notBegSourceCode">Do not “beg”/ask for access to the source code for StepMania 5.3; its source code will be
        released under an open source license at a later date, but we are not currently doing so in
        order to ensure the integrity and quality of pre-release builds (ensuring that only builds
        vetted and tested by the development team are released to the public at this time). There
        are also optional non-free dependencies that we would have to remove before performing a
        open source code release.</li>
</ol>

<p data-translation="moderatorsReserveRights">Moderators and development team members reserve the right to enforce these conduct policies;
    abuse of our platforms may result in warnings or bans from the communities.</p>

<h2 data-translation="changelog">Changelog</h2>
