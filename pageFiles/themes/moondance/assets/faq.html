<h2 data-translation="whatIsFiveThree">What is StepMania 5.3?</h2>

<p data-translation="whatIsFiveThreeExplanation">A project to modernize the 5.0.x/5.1 codebase to improve its performance and provide enhanced
    support for modern hardware and operating systems. We are also adding new features, including
    those being requested by our community, as well as refurbishing its support of non-dance/4-key
    game types, adding new game types, and so forth.</p>

<h2 data-translation="whatIsMoondance">What is Project Moondance?</h2>

<p data-translation="whatIsMoondanceExplanation">It is a community/umbrella for Team Rizu (the 5.3 dev team), covering 5.3/Project OutFox as well
    as other related projects.</p>

<h2 data-translation="willItWorkWithOldStuff">Will it still work with my old songs/themes/etc.?</h2>

<p data-translation="outfoxCompatibility">5.3 builds upon the existing 5.0.12/5.1 beta codebase, and maintaining backwards compatibility
    with older content is one of our main priorities (in fact, this is one of the reasons why the
    version number is 5.3 rather than skipping to a higher number like 6.0). Content that worked on
    5.0.12/5.1 (including songs, themes, and noteskins) should still work on 5.3. If you experience
    any issues/weirdness, please report it to us.</p>

<h3 data-translation="noteForDevs">Side note for developers</h3>

<p data-translation="cmdIsDeprecating">Please note that we are deprecating the use of semicolon-separated <code>cmd()</code> blocks
    (i.e. &nbsp;<code>OnCommand=cmd(linear,1.5;diffusealpha,1);&nbsp;</code>) as a means of placing
    commands on actors in Lua scripts, as this method is a non-standard Lua function that was
    created for StepMania, and 5.3 is not optimized with this coding style in mind (themes may
    experience performance penalties if they use this method). It is strongly recommended that
    function chaining (i.e. code such as
    <code>OnCommand=function(self) self:linear(1.5):diffusealpha(1) end,&nbsp;</code>) be used
    instead.
</p>

<h2 data-translation="outfoxWithOtherVersions">Can I install it alongside existing versions?</h2>

<p data-translation="outfoxPortableMode">Yes. Our installer on Windows also defaults to portable mode, so user profile data is stored in
    your installation directory.</p>

<p data-translation="shareContentWithMultipleBuilds">If you would like to have a shared song library between multiple builds, you can use the
    <code>AdditionalSongFolders</code> preference in <code>Save/Preferences.ini</code> to specify a
    path.
</p>

<h2 data-translation="willThereBeOnlineSupport">Will there be online support?</h2>

<p data-translation="smoIsDeprecated">The existing SMO functionality is deprecated, but we have future plans to develop a revamped
    online system.</p>

<h2 data-translation="whereIsTheSource">Where is the source code?/Why are you not open source?</h2>

<p data-translation="whyItsClosedSource">Right now we are not maintaining a public code repository, but we will open one in the future
    (with plans for it to succeed 5.1 as the mainline branch in the StepMania repository). As 5.3 is
    developing at a rapid pace, allowing source code access at this time would allow users to
    compile their own builds based on incomplete work, which would be difficult for us to debug and
    support during this phase of development..</p>

<p data-translation="howWeWillReleaseTheSource">Our code will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0, an open source license used by a variety
    of major projects (including Android) that provides stronger protections for our rights to be
    attributed for our work (particularly within forks), while maintaining the ability for StepMania
    to remain free and open source as it has always been.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-translation="anyQuestionsAboutTheSource"><span style="background-color: transparent;">If you have any questions related to the 5.3
        code&nbsp;</span><em style="background-color: transparent;">itself</em><span
        style="background-color: transparent;">, feel free to ask one of the development team
        members on our Discord server, and we'll be happy to discuss.</span></p>

    <p data-translation="whyOutfoxStarted">The project began as a method to add online and profiles to SM5, but when we looked into the
        engine to see how this could be appropriated, it was discovered just how much in a sorry
        state the codebase was, and it looked mostly abandoned. I spoke to Shakesoda in hopes of a
        resurrection in the form of a team project, and it was requested rather than breaking 10
        years of content and community to take the time to make a proper 5.x build that is stable
        and supports what the community as a whole wants from the game.</p>

    <p data-translation="backwardCompatiblity">This backward compatibility support has been an absolute git to do, but it's something now we
        are down the line which we are proud of, as it has brought many players and newcomers to the
        community, and provided a very stable experience for folks during the lockdown. We will
        continue to maintain a near 100% compatibility where we can, and this is taken into
        consideration whenever we plan a new feature or change engine components.</p>

    <p data-translation="closedSourceProcess">We asked if it was ok to close the source while this process was done, and it was deemed wise
        for the health of the repo and the need of people who are just wanting to play. Its why
        we've been around the repo but not on it as taint can happen and we do not wish this. SSC
        [Spinal Shark Collective, the 5.0.x development team] did this same behaviour before us, so
        we did not see it as a problem. Some vocal members of the community disagreed, including
        some of the SM dev team. We have also been compared to past SM repo contributors who may
        have left a less than savoury memory in the minds of some, and it has also been hard to
        differentiate from history we have no involvement with.</p>

<h2 data-translation="howCanIContribute">Are there ways I can contribute?</h2>

<ul>
    <li data-translation="reportingBugs">You can report bugs and make feature suggestions on our Discord server.</li>
    <li data-translation="joiningTinyFoxes"><a>TinyFoxes&nbsp;</a>is a branch of Project Moondance
        that is coordinating and hosting community-produced content for 5.3, such as translations
        and other add-ons.</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-translation="whatIsFiveTwoWhySkip">What is 5.2 and why did you skip over it?</h2>

<p data-translation="fiveTwoBrokeCompatibility">5.2 was originally intended to be the next version of StepMania. However, it included a number of
    major changes that broke compatibility with previous versions, and were not well-received by the
    community and other developers.</p>

<p data-translation="fiveTwoCancelled">5.2 was originally meant to be 5.1. However, in response to the reception, it was officially
    delayed in favour of a new 5.1 that was largely an update to 5.0.12 that did not break
    compatibility with existing content. This was done under the presumption that the new version
    (subsequently renamed 5.2) would eventually be completed. However, this did not end up
    happening.</p>

<h1 data-translation="technical">Technical</h1>

<h2 data-translation="controllerDoesntWork">My controller doesn't work, but it did on older versions.</h2>

<p data-translation="xinputCompliant">Alpha 4.5 switched to using an XInput-compliant input system by default; additional configuration
    is needed to use unrecognized controllers in this mode. See <a>here</a>
    for more information on how to map your controller for use in XInput mode on StepMania OutFox.
</p>

<p data-translation="xinputAndLegacyExplanation"><a>As of Alpha 4.8.1</a>, we
    have introduced a HIDAPI-based "Legacy" input system as an option in the Experimental Settings
    menu. It is similar in behaviour to the input system seen in SM 5.0, but rewritten. If you are
    having difficulty getting a controller to work in XInput mode or if it performed better under
    the input handling of previous versions, we recommend that you try it on Legacy mode.</p>

<h2 data-translation="lagWithRecentProcessor">I have a recent/fast processor and my game is having a lot of problems, why is that?</h2>

<p data-translation="lagWithRecentProcessorExplanation">Parts of the game are so well-optimised now that they're running <em>too fast</em>, and the rest
    of the game needs to catch up. We will have a proper fix later, but increasing the amount of
    background activity (i.e. having other programs running in the background, etc.) is a temporary
    solution.</p>

<h2 data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibility">Simply Love is not letting me use it on 5.3</h2>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibilityExplanation">Simply Love does work on 5.3, but since version 4.8, a compatibility warning has been shown by
    the theme if an unsupported version of SM is detected. On 4.8, you can press the Escape button
    twice to bypass the compatibility warning, but 4.9 blocks this workaround.</p>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibilityRemoveCheck">The version check can be removed by opening Scripts/SL-SupportHelpers.lua in the theme, and
    changing the line&nbsp;</p>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibilityRemovingCheckFrom"><code>if not (t[2] and (t[2]==0 or t[2]==1)) then return false end</code></p>

<p data-translation="to">to</p>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibilityRemovingCheckTo"><code>if not (t[2] and (t[2]==0 or t[2]==1 or t[2]==3)) then return false end</code></p>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveCompatibilityWhy">These issues were brought upon by misunderstandings with the theme's developer over our plans for
    5.3 (including concerns over the aforementioned lack of public source repository). These
    concerns <a>were
        able to be resolved</a>, although official support for 5.3 will not be worked on until we
    transition to public source availability.</p>

<p data-translation="simplyLoveTinyFoxesFork">An <a>unofficial fork</a> has been
    created by Project Moondance's TinyFoxes community team, which seeks to perform additional
    tweaks for compatibility and integrations with 5.3</p>

<h2 data-translation="libOpenGLError">I get the error "error while loading shared libraries: libOpenGL.so.0:" on Ubuntu 20.04-based
    distributions</h2>

<p data-translation="libOpenGLFix">Install the <code>libopengl0</code> package. (<code>sudo apt install libopengl0</code>)</p>

<h2 data-translation="issueLaunching">I'm having issues launching the game.</h2>

<p data-translation="noNoteskinsFound">If you receive errors such as "No noteskins found" or other unusual behavior, you will have to
    change macOS security settings in order for Project OutFox to operate correctly. The OS does not
    trust unsigned applications, and prevents access to external files unless given manual
    permission by the user.</p>

<p data-translation="quarantineFix">To do this, open Terminal and run the following command:
    <code>xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/OutFox</code>
</p>

<p data-translation="alternativePath">Alternatively, you can exclude the path, and drag the folder containing the game executable
    directly onto the window.</p>

<p data-translation="olderMacBuilds">On older builds, macOS Catalina also generated a message stating that the game was requesting
    permission to &nbsp;receive keystrokes from any application. This was a side effect of previous
    code that has since been removed.</p>

<h2 data-translation="smallRenderingWindow">The game is rendering small in the bottom corner of the window.</h2>

<p data-translation="smallRenderingWindowFix">This is due to the renderer not supporting scaled screens yet. To fix this, right-click the game
    executable and select "Get info" (or highlight the file and press Command (⌘)+I, and toggle the
    "Open in Low Resolution" option under General.</p>
