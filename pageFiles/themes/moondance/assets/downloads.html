    <ul>
        <li data-translation="whereToReportExplanation">StepMania 5.3 is still under active development, so there will likely still be bugs and
            other quirks. If you encounter issues or have any comments or questions, be sure to
            report or discuss them on our <strong><a>GitHub for public
                    issue
                    tracking</a></strong>, Discord server, or forum.</li>
        <li data-translation="whenUpgradingExplanation">If upgrading from a previous build, be sure to <strong>uninstall it</strong> and delete
            the Appearance/Themes folder in the installation directory before installing the next
            build, or install it in a separate directory. In-place upgrades between versions may
            create conflicts that can result in unusual behaviour.</li>
        <li data-translation="controllerProblemsExplanation">If your controller does not work properly on StepMania 5.3, but did on earlier versions,
            see the <strong><a>controller guide</a></strong> for more
            information.</li>
        <li data-translation="armBuildExplanation">For ARM builds, type <code>uname -a</code> at a shell to determine the correct
            architecture release to download.</li>
        <li data-translation="macBuildExplanation">For macOS builds, please see the <a>macOS
                section of the FAQ page</a> for information on OS security settings required to run
            the game.</li>
