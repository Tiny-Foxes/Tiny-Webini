        <p data-translation="readInstallationGuide">Be sure to read the <a href="https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/install/">installation guide</a> before continuing. For ARM builds, type <code>uname -a</code> at a shell to determine the correct architecture release to download.</p>

            <li data-translation="whereToReportExplanation">Project OutFox is still under active development, so there will likely still be bugs and other quirks. If you encounter issues or have any comments or questions, be sure to report or discuss them on our <strong><a href="https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox/issues">GitHub for public issue tracking</a></strong>, Discord server, or forum.</li>
            <li data-translation="whenUpgradingExplanation">If upgrading from a previous build, be sure to <strong>uninstall it</strong> and delete the <code>Appearance/Themes</code> and <code>Cache</code> folder in the installation directory before installing the next build, or install it in a separate directory. In-place upgrades between versions may create conflicts that can result in unusual behaviour.</li>
            <li data-translation="controllerProblemsExplanation">If your controller does not work properly on Project OutFox, but did on existing versions on StepMania, see the <strong><a href="https://outfox.wiki/user-guide/setup/controllers/">controller guide</a></strong> for more information.</li>
