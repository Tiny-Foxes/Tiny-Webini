<p data-translation="whatIsOutFoxCommunityPackProject">The<strong> OutFox Community Pack Project </strong>is creating new simfiles to be included as part of Project OutFox's default content. This is a non-competitive event, intended to showcase our community and their skills! We are aiming for "libre" content, so that songs from the Community Pack Project can be freely included with our packages.</p>

<p data-translation="howToParticipate">You can participate as a music artist (by submitting your works), step artist (by creating charts for music submissions) or designer (by creating the graphics for music submissions). You may send multiple submissions. You can also participate on more than one category simultaneously, if you wish. All participants should read and understand the guidelines below before signing up.</p>

<p data-translation="finalProduct">The final product for each approved complete submission is:</p>

<ol>
	<li data-translation="music">Music</li>
	<li data-translation="charts">Charts</li>
	<li data-translation="graphics">Graphics</li>
</ol>

<p data-translation="participationExplanation">Again, you don’t need to submit everything in order to participate. After the initial review to ensure they meet the requirements, all music submissions will be assigned to step artists and designers in order to create their accompanying step charts and graphics.</p>
