        <p data-translation="whatIsStepmaniaExplanation"><strong>StepMania</strong> is an open source rhythm game engine. It is primarily used to
            simulate the gameplay of <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>, but it is capable of
            simulating other types of key-based rhythm games as well. StepMania has been developed
            since 2000, and has also been used as the engine of commercial arcade dance games such
            as <em>In the Groove</em>, and <em>Pump it Up Pro</em> and <em>Infinity</em>.</p>

        <p data-translation="whatIsOutFoxExplanation"><strong>StepMania 5.3 "OutFox"</strong> is the next version of StepMania, under

                    <p><strong>StepMania 5.3 Alpha 4.9.6</strong> has been released! </p>
                    <p>This is our first official build with a native binary avaliable for the new
                        ARM-based Macs (Apple M1). With this release, we are one of the first
                        macOS-compatible games to have a version compiled natively for Apple M1, and
                        one of the first with full controller and pad support as well. We demoed the
                        build, as well as its controller support, in a <a>recent
                            Twitch broadcast</a>.</p>
                    <p>This is our final build for 2020, and also marks the one-year anniversary of
                        our first public release!</p>
