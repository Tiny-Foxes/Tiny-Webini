                    <p><strong>Project OutFox 5.3 Alpha 4.9.8</strong> has been released! There is a
                        <em>lot</em> to go over with this release, including new game modes,
                        user-facing features, and other internal bug fixes and improvements.</p>
                    <h1>Gameplay features</h1>
                    <h2>Game types</h2>
                    <p>One of our major goals with 5.3 has been to improve its various gametypes,
                        and add new ones never implemented in StepMania before. Many of them have
                        been neglected for years or even a decade, so they have been buggy and
                        incomplete.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/uploads/public/608/313/4d7/6083134d740ec451733559.png"
                            alt="modes-diagram.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
                    <p>Alpha 4.9.8 contains improvements to a number of gametypes (including new
                        styles, and updates to the parsers for BMS and PMS), as well as one
                        brand-new gametype:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>gdgf</strong> (renamed from "guitar"): We have added a 6-fret
                            style. This mode and its sister drum gametype <strong>gddm</strong> will
                            support a <code>DTX</code> loader in the future, but you can also use
                            the built-in editor to author drum and guitar charts in the standard
                            <code>.SSC</code> format too.</li>
                        <li><strong>popn</strong>: This mode has been around for a very long time,
                            but has not really had any support or been looked at since before 2010.
                            It was side-lined into the <code>BMS</code> loader, which actually broke
                            a lot of the needed changes <code>PMS</code> actually uses, and as a
                            result most PMS files with 7 or 9 lanes, would be added to the game as
                            beat 10-lane or 14-lane charts. We thank the anonymous reporter of this
                            bug, as Squirrel took the time to investigate it and we decided to
                            return a new modernised PMS loader to the game, which now correctly
                            loads PMS songs as they should be. This also removes the oddity and edge
                            crashes when anyone wished to play this mode on OutFox. With these
                            changes. we have been able to load packs such as Colorful Channel with
                            no issue.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The new loader can also handle long notes, the 06 (POOR), 07
                                    (BG2) and 0A (LAYER 2) BGA channels, and the ITEM channel.</li>
                                <li>In addition, we have support for 3-lane (battle), 4-lane,
                                    5-lane, and 7-lane charts, while community member Daniel has
                                    contributed several new noteskins specifically for popn mode
                                    too.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>para</strong>: A double style has been added.</li>
                        <li><strong>techno</strong>: 9-panel and 18-panel styles have been added. In
                            addition, a new version of Broadhead with column-based colors has been
                            added as a global noteskin and as the default for <code>techno</code>.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>gh</strong>: A new 5-fret (and 6-fret coming soon) gametype
                            based on a collection of popular games that used a guitar-styled
                            controller to press frets and strum along to bass and guitar parts of a
                            song.
                            <ul>
                                <li>It can load charts in the <code>.chart</code> and
                                    <code>.midi</code> formats, and supports co-operative
                                    multiplayer (i.e. one player can play a bass or rhythm guitar
                                    chart while the other plays lead guitar, for example).</li>
                                <li>To implement this gametype, new note types were added, and
                                    internal changes were made so that its code doesn't have to be
                                    squished around <code>dance</code>-centric code. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/uploads/public/608/110/3b6/6081103b6229f325350043.jpg"
                            alt="StepMania_WBuGwTLnhj.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
                    <p>All gametypes have access to features such as the built-in chart editor and
                        modifier systems, allowing you to extend your content to as many as
                        <strong>52 styles in 14 gametypes</strong> as of this release.</p>
                    <p>Most gametypes currently have a "preliminary" implementation, meaning that
                        they are functional but may be missing features. They also run within the
                        default Soundwaves theme, which was primarily designed for the
                        <code>dance</code> gametype and its associated paradigms, and may not
                        necessarily work well with all gametypes. The next phase of implementation
                        will be to give each gametype a tailored theme and user experience, so that
                        they will no longer have to be shoehorned into an interface they aren't
                        meant for.</p>
                    <p>Most of these modes are sadly-neglected and have been without support or a
                        maintainer for upwards of a decade, so be a touch sympathetic to them if you
                        decide to take the time to explore, they will be given the love they
                        deserve. We are going to stop the trend of "adding new stuff then doing
                        nothing with it" that was so common in the project we are formed from.</p>
                    <p>Given that we now have more gametypes that aren't step-based over those that
                        are, we have also made a decision to reinstate the <strong>Project
                            OutFox</strong> name for our builds going forward rather than StepMania.
                        None of this means we are abandoning step games, though.</p>
                    <h2>LiftHolds</h2>
                    <p>We have added a new option for hold and roll tails known as a "LiftHold",
                        where the player must let go at the end of the hold. You can add them to
                        charts by using <code>DL</code> instead of <code>3</code> to end a hold or
                        roll in the .ssc file, while a modifier is available to change all holds and
                        rolls in a chart to LiftHolds.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/uploads/public/608/1a2/ef1/6081a2ef1e141876856132.png"
                            alt="lifthold-tail.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
                    <h2>New pause menu</h2>
                    <p>Due to limitations in how pause menus are currently implemented in-game (we
                        need to change it in order to support the new BGA layers needed for for BMS,
                        PMS, and DTX. Plus, since it was an actor in
                        <code>ScreenGameplay overlay</code>, it became invisible if a song [such as
                        the majority of mod files] toggles its visibility), we have made a new
                        implementation of one within the fallback theme.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/uploads/public/608/1a2/41d/6081a241d6e04569881361.png"
                            alt="115640138-27f26a00-a30e-11eb-94f1-6cb697b01ace.png"
                            class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
                    <p>It appears instantly once the <code>Back</code> button is pressed; we may
                        restore the existing "Hold <code>Back</code> to give up" behaviour as an
                        option in the future.</p>
                    <p>Theme developers can enable the new pause menu by setting the the metric
                        <code>UsePauseMenu=true</code> under <code>[ScreenGameplay]</code>. A basic
                        menu design is provided, but it can be customized by themes. We have
                        maintained backwards compatibility with themes which do not enable it.</p>
                    <h1>Technical changes</h1>
                    <h2>Timing changes</h2>
                    <p>Since Alpha 4.9.7GG we have slightly adjusted the renderer pipeline to
                        optimize how we deal with frames within the kernel timer of the OS. This is
                        to prepare for new sound/rendering drivers coming in the near future, but as
                        we've found with a lot in this game, baby steps to fix little blockers
                        before we do major updates. We also have removed more of the Rage engine in
                        favour of modern mathematics algorithms, and this has needed a slight tweak
                        to the order on how we draw things.</p>
                    <p>if you find your median timing skews early or late (like the example below)
                        after migrating to 4.9.8, take a moment to <a

                            class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
                    <h2>Video upscaler</h2>
                    <p>We have implemented the ability to change the <a
                            href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-scaler.html">scaler algorithm</a> used
                        by FFmpeg for videos in Project OutFox, via the preference
                        <code>VideoUpScaleFilter</code>. If you have an older system, take the time
                        to experiment with the different algorithms and see how it affects your
                        performance, as this will add a little load onto your system.</p>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>Input</h2>
                    <p>We have added a new preference, <code>UsingArcadePads</code>, which will
                        allow you to use the input driver for Python boards natively without any
                        freezes. As per the "starworlds" StepMania branch, you need to set
                        <code>InputDrivers=Python23IO,SDL</code> in Preferences.ini. This will set
                        up your board driver, and allow you to use keyboard/XInput/Bluetooth
                        controllers to control the game while you're on your pad (if you exclude SDL
                        as input, you will have no keyboard input!). </p>
                    <p>You will need to set <code>UseOldJoystickMapping=0</code> as well, so the
                        game will initialise the XInput controller driver alongside your Python
                        board. This preference only currently supports the Python23IO driver, but
                        will be expanded to Reflex and other drivers in the future.</p>
