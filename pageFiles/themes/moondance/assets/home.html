        <p data-translation="whatIsOutFoxExplanation"><strong>Project OutFox</strong> is a fork of StepMania, focused on modernizing its
            codebase to improve performance, refurbish neglected code, and introduce new features to
            the engine, and to improve its support for other styles of rhythm games beyond just
            dance games to create a cross-platform “sandbox” and “museum” for the genre. It is
            developed a team of community veterans and other current members of the current

                    <p>"Alpha V" is our internal codename for the next major alpha of Project
                        OutFox, Alpha 5.0; we have a number of new things planned for it, and one of
                        them is a new default theme.</p>
                    <p>While Soundwaves served us well as a transitional interface, it was still
                        built around many of the same behaviours associated with StepMania,
                        including a "one size fits all" approach to handling game types that is less
                        than ideal, and dizzying options menus that even <em>we</em> have trouble
                        navigating. Long story short, on Alpha V we plan to replace Soundwaves with
                        a new default theme, which will be modern and better-suited to our current
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>Actually, no. There will not just be <em>one</em> replacement for Soundwaves,
                        or two, or three. Our goal will be to give <em>every</em> major game type
                        its own default theme. Each game has its own requirements, including
                        different ways we need to render gameplay, different behaviours we have to
                        simulate, and so on, so it quickly becomes unwieldy to <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkz7bnYfuOI">put everything in the
                            square hole</a> as we have in the past. A general goal with these new
                        themes will be a narrower focus, modularity, and improving support for
                        different input methods. <strong>We are also aiming to support
                            frequently-requested features, such as song favourites and different
                            sorting methods.</strong></p>
                    <p>In this post, we will be previewing just a few of the new themes we have been
                        working on, with a focus on those that have had the most in-engine work so
                        far. You may have already seen in-game footage of some of these new themes
                        in the OutFox Serenity trailer, or teased in discussions on our Discord
                        server. </p>
                    <p><em>Some of these images are mockups, and in any case the designs are subject
                            to change based on feedback and implementation. If you have any
                            feedback, ideas, or questions regarding these Alpha V, we have added a
                            new <code>#alpha5-wishlist</code> channel to our Discord server where
                            you can discuss them.</em></p>
                    <h2>pump</h2>
                    <p>Our new <code>pump</code> theme features a more familiar layout and control
                        scheme, integrated with OutFox features such as our chart statistics and NPS
                        displays, as well as mouse/touchscreen support.</p>

                        mouse/touchscreen support in mind, carrying over popular features from
                        Soundwaves, but with an overhauled codebase, a revamped workflow, and <a

                        system from Soundwaves is also being revamped, making it easier to share

                        optional stats and NPS graph to show just how much of a storm you're

                        by live music. The gameplay screenshots showcase a combination of noteskins,
                        theme-level code, and new theme features introduced on Alpha 4.9.10 that

                        <code>gh</code> in mind, it is also usable in other game types with a few

                    <p>Dear OutFox Community,</p>
                    <p>As we move closer towards the release of Alpha V, and after the issues we had
                        with the release of 4.9.9, we would like to address some of the things that
                        as a team we have noticed over the past few months. As a community, we're
                        not sure if the addition of a Discord server has caused some of these issues
                        and behaviour, or if it's the fact that we are more easily accessible than
                        if we were on a forum or IRC channel. We are writing this post to make our
                        stance and that of our staff and volunteers, as well as those who contribute
                        time or content to make the game better.</p>
                    <p>We love OutFox, and still love a lot of the things that StepMania was. The
                        name change was needed so we can sign our MacOS (and soon Windows) builds.
                        There is no conspiracy about moving away from the core playerbase. There are
                        no other issues about us 'abandoning' our dedication and efforts on
                        improving StepMania via it's own repository in the future with some form of
                        update from our team as discussed with Shakesoda. There is also no
                        conspiracy theory about us hating 'dance' based games. Just because 4/5
                        panel is not literally everything we live and breathe does not make it
                        correct for you to throw out misinformation or treat us in a way that moves
                        toward literal cyberbullying to the team. We understand your passion and
                        drive for the modes that you play, but this does not give you any right to
                        try to enforce that view in a negative manner towards us.</p>
                    <p>What we don't love at all is continued demands and entitlement - something
                        that over the past two to three months has begun to get extremely volatile
                        from certain communities and individuals. OutFox is not our life or
                        existence. OutFox also is not our job. We code and develop (and support)
                        OutFox as our fun and to drive us to do better. We will always do our best
                        to fix things or do things as fast as possible, including updates, bugfixes,
                        support, handling feature requests, supporting legacy 5.1/5.0 code,
                        providing support for players who don't even use OutFox, etc. This also is
                        true when that demand is your first or one of your only interactions with
                        our team or server. </p>
                    <p>Before you ask us, (or anyone else in your life) to do something for you,
                        please take time to carefully consider what you are asking for, and where
                        this expectation has come from. We are extremely patient and generous here
                        at Project OutFox, so some expectation of us for very little in return is
                        something we have become used to; including community support, bug support,
                        even code support and providing test builds to fix issues folks have. What
                        you are not entitled to however, is to expect some defined service level or
                        response time, or to demand information at a whim. We do things as quickly
                        as constraints of life allow. Whether that be minutes, hours, days or weeks,
                        you have no entitlement to expect one or the other. The game gets
                        improvements as and when - if you cannot see the improvements this brings to
                        your specific mode of play, then that is a shame. As we improve the engine
                        it benefits more than just a specified mode, and this is the future of
                        OutFox. It will become more than what it was when we took the reins, and
                        that is to support a brand new rhythm game sandbox moving forward.</p>
                    <p>We thank you for continuing to support the project, but for the sanity of the
                        team, we felt this issue needs to be addressed before it gets out of hand,
                        or worse we suffer from the demands of people who do not consider how their
                        actions affect the team.</p>
