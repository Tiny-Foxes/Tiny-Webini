<h1 class="page-title">About Project Moondance</h1>
<p data-translation="whatIsMoondanceExplanation">Project Moondance is an overall effort to modernize and revitalize the open source rhythm gaming
    engine StepMania. It is led by Team Rizu, a development team led by community veteran Squirrel,
    as well as many other prominent members of the current community.</p>

<p data-translation="originsOfMoondance">It was originally conceived as being a complete fork of the engine. However, we have since gained
    the support of its current lead developer, and are currently working on an experimental branch
    codenamed "OutFox" – based on version 5.1. OutFox focuses primarily on refactoring low-level
    portions of the engine in preparation for future development, including code modernization to
    improve performance, as well as changes to its graphics architecture to provide more complete
    support for modern hardware.</p>

<p data-translation="plansOfMoondance">However, OutFox is only the first stage of our plans: “Serene” is a future project that will
    significantly refactor the engine to make it a true video game engine for rhythm games, with
    wide support for various game play styles and input schemes, including touchscreens.</p>

<h1 class="page-title" data-translation="aboutOutFox">About Project OutFox</h1>

<p data-translation="whatIsOutFox">Project OutFox is a development branch focused primarily on the internal codebase to improve
    performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware
    and other platforms (including single-board embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi). Improvements
    to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on older hardware, as far back as the Pentium
    E2180. It also incorporates a new default theme with more integrated features than previous
    versions, and new internal functions that can be used for future content.</p>

<p data-translation="outfoxCompatibility">As Project OutFox is a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains
    compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these
    versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it
    to us as a bug).</p>

<p data-translation="outfoxIsFiveTwo">5.3 is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it
    was renamed</p>
